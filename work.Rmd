So we have to first load the library. 
```{r}
library(d3heatmap)
```

# The fun stuff:

### Data munging. 

```{r}
#Load the data in. 
d = read.csv("data/exon2_for_r.csv")

#Combine the first two rows for create unique row names. 
rowNames <- paste(d$position, d$base, sep = "-")

#Drop the non-numeric data
d = d[,c(-1,-2,-7)]

#Turn NAs into 0s. Hopefully we can change this soon. 
d[is.na(d)] <- 0

#Assign the row names and rename the columns to make them simpler. 
rownames(d) <- rowNames
colnames(d) <- c("a", "t", "g", "c")
```


### ...and now we plot. 
```{r}
d3heatmap(d, scale = "column", colors = "Spectral", Rowv = NULL, Colv = NULL)
```
